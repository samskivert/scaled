/** Coordinates metadata and operations for a workspace. A workspace defines an environment
  * tailored to working on a particular software artifact. Each workspace is like a separate Scaled
  * installation, customized specially for the desired task. Multiple editor windows may be open
  * for a single workspace.
  *
  * The core editor uses workspaces as a configuration grouping, i.e. one can customize modes, etc.
  * specially for a particular workspace.
  *
  * A workspace also serves as a useful abstraction for external services. For example the project
  * services use workspaces to collect a group of related projects, resolve inter-project
  * dependencies specially for projects that are added to the workspace, and to provide
  * workspace-wide searching and navigation functionality.
