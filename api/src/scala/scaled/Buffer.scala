/** Manages a sequence of characters, providing a line-by-line view and the means to translate
  * between character offset and line offset plus (intra-line) character offset. This isolates the
  * read-only API, see [[Buffer]] for the mutable API and [[RBuffer]] for the reactive-mutable API.
  *
  * Note: there's only one implementation of buffers, but the API factorization exists to allow
  * differing degrees of control to be exposed depending on the circumstances. If someone should
  * not be allowed to mutate a buffer, they can be supplied with a `BufferV` reference. If they can
  * mutate, but should not be allowed to register (possibly memory leak-inducing) reactive
  * handlers, they can be supplied with a `Buffer` reference. If they should have all the games and
  * all the puzzles, they get an `RBuffer` reference.
  *
  * For better and worse, the JVM allows you to downcast to the more powerful type. That's a bad
  * idea. Don't do it. Consider yourself warned.
  *
  * @define RNLNOTE Note: the last line does not conceptually include a trailing newline, and
  * [[insert(Loc,Seq[LineV])]] takes this into account.
