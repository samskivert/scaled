/** Provides a handle via which one can communicate with a concurrent sequential process. A
  * concurrent sequential process is a collection of code and data which runs sequentially (multiple
  * threads are never executing code in the process at the same time) but which runs concurrently
  * with all other sequential processes. Note: this is more like actors than traditional CSP.
  *
  * The process itself is an object which should only be accessed via its pipe. Ideally nothing
  * retains a reference to the process object itself as that would allow methods to be invoked on
  * the process object from (potentially) the wrong thread. Only retain a reference to a process's
  * pipe, and there's no risk of doing things incorrectly.
  *
  * In Scaled, each [[Service]] is implemented by a process. Services may also spawn other processes
  * where appropriate and pass out their pipes.
  *
  * There are three ways to communicate with a process:
  *
  *  - [[tell]]ing it something: this is a fire-and-forget mechanism to invoke code on the
  *    process "eventually"
  *
  *  - [[ask]]ing it something: this sends a request to the process and blocks the caller until the
  *    result is received. This is the most common way to communicate with processes. Most requests
  *    can be satisfied immediately by the process, so the tiny overhead of coordinated inter-thread
  *    communication is no reason to weird your code with asynchronicity. Note: no special deadlock
  *    avoidance is performed, so avoid massive chains of processes asking things.
  *
  *  - [[req]]uesting something: this sends a request to the process and returns a [[Future]] via
  *    which the result is made available. If you're asking for something that might actually take
  *    a long time, then this is the appropriate mechanism.
  *
  * Pipe also implements `Executor` allowing runnables to be queued up for execution in the
  * process's threading context.
  *
  * @define SAMECTX `f` will never be invoked immediately, even if the calling thread is currently
  * in this entity's execution context.
